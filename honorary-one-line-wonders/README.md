# What is this folder about?
#### This folder stores honorary attempts as well as other short code snippets.
#### This could include code that would otherwise be in one of the main language folders and is almost a "one-liner" but does not meet some criteria, such as using `;` instead of a new line.

### What do I do if my intended "one-line" program gets moved here?
No worries, you can still try to create a new file for your program "in one line" and submit another Pull Request for review. See https://github.com/kannagikazuko/one-line-wonders/blob/master/README.md for more information.

### Am I still eligible for a free shirt for Hacktoberfest if I end up contributing here?
Yes! You just need to open 5 Pull Requests not flagged as spam!

### What do I do if a program gets moved here when it should not have?
Open an issue! I or a repository collaborator, will look into it! Please provide supporting evidence as appropriate and an explanation of why that "one-line" program is the shortest number of lines for a runnable program in the language to exist.
